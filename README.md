# AWS_EC2mail
A wrapper to send mail via AWS EC2 instance
I have written this wrapper to send email notifications via Amazon EC2. This original source code can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-using-sdk-python.html. This wrapper provides an easy to use API to send an email notification while using an EC2 instance. A common usecase of this wrapper include sending a notification email after a training or optimizing a deep-learning model.
